# Instructions:
# - Copy this file locally (no git necessary)
# - apt install ansible
# - sudo ansible-playbook ansible-playbook.yaml --extra-vars="user=$USER"
#
# If you want to test only and only one task, tag it like this:
#
#   tags:
#     - lalala
#
# and then run ansible with --tags=lalala
#
#
# When developing this playbook, pass --skip-tags=dot-files-repo
# to skip checking out this repo, as it won't work.
